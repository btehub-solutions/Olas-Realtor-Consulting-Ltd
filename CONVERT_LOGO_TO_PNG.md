# Convert Logo to PNG Format

## Why PNG Format?

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format is recommended for logos because:
- **Transparent Background** - Works seamlessly on any colored background
- **No Quality Loss** - Lossless compression maintains crisp edges
- **Better for Web** - Ideal for graphics with text and sharp lines
- **Professional Look** - Transparent logos look more polished

## Current Status

Your logo is currently saved as: `OLAS UPDATED LOGO.jpg`
